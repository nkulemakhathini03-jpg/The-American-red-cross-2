i# The American Red Cross Website Prototype

### Project Overview

This project is a prototype for a website redesign for the American Red Cross. It is designed as a static, responsive website to demonstrate the core structure and design for key pages. This project is created for educational purposes, following the proposal and design requirements.

### Part 2: Design and Responsiveness

This phase of the project focused on the visual appeal and user experience of the website. Key improvements and implementations include:

* **External Stylesheet:** A new, external `style.css` file was created and linked to all HTML pages to ensure a consistent look and feel across the site.
* **CSS Styling:**
    * **Typography:** Custom typography styles were applied to headlines, body text, and links for enhanced readability.
    * **Layout:** CSS Flexbox and Grid were used to create a modern, flexible layout that organizes content effectively on various screen sizes.
* **Responsive Design:**
    * **Breakpoints:** Media queries were implemented to create key breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, ensuring the layout adapts seamlessly.
    * **Relative Units:** Relative units like `rem` and percentages were used for font sizes and widths to maintain proportionality on different screens.
    * **Responsive Images:** The homepage hero image is now set as a CSS background, which handles responsiveness automatically.

### Changelog

* **`index.html`:** The page content was corrected to match the homepage requirements, replacing the incorrect donation form content. The logo and other image tags were also cleaned up.
* **`donate.html` & `get-help.html`:** Misplaced and duplicated image tags within the content sections were removed to ensure a clean and correct layout.
* **`contact.html`:** Ensured the link to the external `style.css` file was present.
* **`style.css`:** A new, comprehensive stylesheet was created from scratch to handle all styling, including base styles, layout, and responsive design for all pages.
* **'No JavaScript Added':** No JavaScript was added in this part of the assignment. The script.js file is prepared for development in a future part of the project
